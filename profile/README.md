## IntelliGen: Smart Generator Management with AI

IntelliGen is a mobile application designed to empower individuals and businesses to optimize their smart generator operations. By harnessing data collected through Arduino kits, IntelliGen provides users with:

* **Real-time insights:** Monitor key generator metrics like engine hours, fuel level, and temperature directly on your mobile device.
* **AI-powered predictions:** Gain insights into future generator performance and proactively address potential issues. 
* **Data visualization & historical analysis:** Analyze historical data trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.
* **Fuel management optimization:** IntelliGen's AI helps you optimize fuel usage and minimize operational costs.
* **Collaboration:** Share generator data and insights with team members for efficient management.
* **Offline functionality:** Access cached data even without an internet connection (data syncs upon reconnection).

**Our Goal**

Our goal is to empower users with intelligent tools to manage their smart generators more effectively. IntelliGen helps users:

* **Maximize generator uptime**
* **Reduce maintenance costs**
* **Extend generator lifespan**
* **Make data-driven decisions**
