## IntelliGen Project Summary

**Project Overview**

IntelliGen is a mobile application designed to empower individual owners and businesses to effectively monitor and manage their smart generators. By harnessing data collected through Arduino kits, IntelliGen provides users with real-time insights, historical analysis, and AI-powered predictions. This suite of features equips users to optimize generator performance, maximize uptime, and minimize operational costs.

**Target Audience**

* Individual generator owners
* Small and medium-sized businesses that utilize generators

**Key Features**

* **Data Visualization**
    * Real-time dashboards showcasing critical generator metrics (engine hours, fuel level, temperature, etc.)
    * Historical data analysis with filtering, aggregation, and visualization tools
    * Customizable dashboards for tailored data presentation
* **AI Predictions**
    * Forecasts for future values of key metrics
    * Proactive maintenance recommendations based on anticipated issues
    * Fuel management optimization strategies
    * Confidence intervals to understand prediction uncertainties
* **Collaboration**
    * Invite collaborators to access and analyze generator data
    * Role-based permissions for granular control over user access and actions
* **Offline Functionality**
    * Access to cached data even in scenarios with limited or no internet connectivity
    * Automatic data synchronization upon reconnection
* **User Management**
    * Secure user accounts and permissions
    * Customizable preferences for language, units, and data display

**Technology Stack**

* **Frontend:** React Native, Tailwind CSS, Expo
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Prisma
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Data Acquisition:** Arduino

**Data Management**

* Data reduction on Arduino using pre-processing, sampling, and statistical summaries.
* Backend data aggregation and downsampling for efficient storage and retrieval optimization.
* Frontend data visualization with interactive filtering, zooming, and level of detail controls.
* Data retention policies for managing raw and aggregated data storage.

**System Design and Architecture**

**Design Patterns**

* **Frontend:** Component-based architecture, state management (Redux/MobX), data fetching patterns (lazy loading/pagination).
* **Backend:** MVC/MVP, RESTful API design, dependency injection.
* **Arduino:** Event-driven programming, state machine pattern.

**System Design**

* Client-server architecture (microservices implementation optional).
* MongoDB database.
* Scalability techniques (horizontal/vertical scaling, sharding, caching).
* Security measures (authentication/authorization, data encryption, secure coding practices).

**Additional Considerations**

* Gamification elements to enhance user engagement.
* Support for a variety of user roles and permissions.
* Continuous improvement driven by user feedback and data analysis.
* Offline functionality through local data storage and synchronization capabilities.
